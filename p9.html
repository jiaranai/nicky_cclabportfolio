      <h2>
      Design Process  
      </h2>
      <p>
      To design a consentful interface, I followed Una Lee's and Dann Toliver's "Building Consentful Tech" Zine.
      I made sure to follow the 5 acronyms of consentful interface, FRIES.
      </p>
      <p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>F</b>reely Given</li>
            <li><b>R</b>eversible</li>
            <li><b>I</b>nformed</li>
            <li><b>E</b>nthusiastic</li>
            <li><b>S</b>pecific</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>
        Design Goals
      </h2>
      <p>
      I wanted the interface to look friendly so I decided to design it in a playful way, using a female cartoon character
      to guide them through the consent form. The character also educates users on how to reverse their consent. I decided to use languages
      that are easy to understand and made the consent form very short - to the point. 
      </p>
      <br><b>How does my design respond to FRIES?</b>
      <p>
      The app allows users to make their own decisions without pressure, force or manipulation. When users decide to click
      no, they are redirected to a page that says "we respect your privacy!" with a friendly cartoon face saying bye to the user.
      Users are also able to reverse their decision by changing their consent on the camera screen. Moreover, users are always informed
      on what consent they are giving. All technical jargon such as meta-data are defined for the users. Moreover, there is also a sample
      of the camera output for the users to see before they accept the terms and conditions. Although users may be enthusiastic
      to use the app, the app will always ask for their consent. Lastly, the consent form is specific and tells the users exactly what data is collected.
      In this case, none of their data's collected.

      Below are the flow charts and page drafts I created prior to coding my interface.

      <h2>
        Reflection
         </h2>
          <p>
         My consentful interface recontextualized user interaction and experience by making consent forms clear and concise. It is a system that is transparent,
         easy to understand, and reversible. The user has full knowledge of what they are consenting to all the time and there's no pressure for them to accept 
          the app's terms and conditions. I think this is how all user interfaces should be. This way, we do not allow any company to collect and sell our data without
          our full knowledge, and users can feel safer entering a website.
